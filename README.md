ProgeSQL Homework

Working with SQL was challenging and the bonus was more than interesting

The first thing I face was to perform more than one JOIN with SQL tables, I had to do a little research
Additionally I strugle a little trying to get the employees who where hired in 1986, because I coudnt find
the right way to do the Query. At the end I was just a matter of using a single quote and not double quote

At the bonus, I decided to use straight the SQL Queries with pd.read_sql, instead of importing everything and 
perform the data parsing in pandas.

One of the things I wasn't able to pass using pd.read_sql in this point was the use of an alias in SQL, so I had to
use the SQL script and after importing the data I just changed the column name. This is just a mental note for me to do 
a little more of research in this sense

Thanks very much. This homework was as all previous assignments very interesting and fascinating
